A Response to [Ghostery breaking some websites](https://twitter.com/jeresig/status/299915982753894400)

Feel free to submit pull requests to add more analytics packages, and let me know when this is no longer necessary.

This is more of a "blanket" approach than in general.

TODO:

	- This doesn't react to ghostery blocking js, it just overwrites all things.
	- Add more support than just Google Analytics.
